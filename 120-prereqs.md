## Status: Stable

## Overview
The `prereqs.yaml` file describes any pre-requisites that the the CASE may require of a target cluster. This specification uses the concept of Resolver to return a boolean result from the body of the object. The resolver can then be referenced by the inventory item [Action rules](220-actions.md#prereq-rules) to construct expressions.

## Specification
The `prereqs.yaml` has the following attributes:

* `prereqs`: The roles available to the CASE inventory item actions.
  * `metadata`:  General metadata about the prereqs. See [CASE Metadata](010-case-structure.md#Specification-metadata-and-versioning) for details.
  * `prereqDefs`: The prereq resolvers.
    * `k8sResources`:  The resolver for Kubernetes resources. See [k8sResources](#k8sResources).
    * `k8sResourceVersions`: The resolver for Kubernetes resource API versions. See [k8sResourceVersions](#k8sResourceVersions).
    * `k8sDistros`: The resolver for Kubernetes distribution vendor and version. See [k8sDistros](#k8sDistros).
    * `helm`: The resolver for Helm versions. See [helm](#helm).
    * `client`: The client-side program requirements. See [client](#client).
    * `ibmCoreServices`  The resolver for IBM core services. See [ibmCoreServices](#ibmCoreServices).

### k8sResources
This resolver is used to identify specific instances of resources in the target Kubernetes cluster.

The `k8sResources` resource is a set of objects each with the following attributes:
* `<Resource Name>`:  A [CASE Property](010-case-structure.md#yaml-file-format) describing the resource.  (Required)
  * `metadata`:  Describes the resource.  See [CASE Metadata](010-case-structure.md#Specification-metadata-and-versioning) for details.
  * `kind`:  The kind of resource to resolve.
  * `apiGroup`:  The API Group of the resource.
  * `version`:  The version of the resource API.
  * `name`:  The name of the resource (required if not specifying a `selector` or `fieldSelector`)
  * `selector`:  The label selector (optional)
    * `matchExpressions`:  The label match expression map.  See the [Kubernetes matchExpressions documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/#resources-that-support-set-based-requirements).
  * `fieldSelector`:  The field selector chain (optional)
    * `matchExpressions`:  The field match expression chain. SEe the [Kubernetes field-selectors documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/field-selectors/).


### k8sResourceVersions
This resolver is used to identify specific resource kinds and versions in the target Kubernetes cluster.

The `k8sResourceVersions` resource is an array of objects each with the following attributes:
* `<Resource Type Name>`:  A [CASE Property](010-case-structure.md#yaml-file-format) describing the resource type.  (Required)
  * `metadata`:  Describes the resource version.  See [CASE Metadata](010-case-structure.md#Specification-metadata-and-versioning) for details.
  * `kind`:  The kind of resource to resolve.
  * `apiGroup`:  The API Group of the resource.
  * `version`:  The version of the resource API.



### k8sDistros
This resolver is used to identify the vendor and version of the target Kubernetes cluster.  Each Distribution Resolver includes distribution-unique rules for determining the vendor of the distribution.  If the vendor is not required, use the `kubernetes` resolver.

The `k8sDistros` resource is an set objects each with the following attributes:
* `<Distribution Resolver>`:  One of a set of pre-defined kubernetes distribution resolvers
  * `metadata`:  Describes the distro.  See [CASE Metadata](010-case-structure.md#Specification-metadata-and-versioning) for details.
  * `semver`: The semantic version constraint of the Kubernetes distribution (optional).  See [semver version constraints](#semver-version-constraints).

#### Distribution Resolvers
Each Kubernetes distribution resolver is a well known name which include:

* `kubernetes` - This is the default resolver when no other distribution can be resolved.
* `ibmCloud` - IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service
* `ibmCloudPrivate` - IBM Cloud Private
* `openshift` - Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform
* `googleGKE` - Google Kubernetes Engine
* `azureAKS` - Azure Kubernetes Service
* `amazonEKS` - Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes

### helm
This resolver is used to identify the version of Helm and/or Tiller.  If this resolver is present, then a Helm client must be configured and available.

The `helm` resource has the following attributes:
* `<Helm Prereq Name>`: A [CASE Property](010-case-structure.md#yaml-file-format) describing the Helm prerequisite.  (Required)
  * `metadata`: Describes the Helm prerequisite. See [CASE Metadata](010-case-structure.md#Specification-metadata-and-versioning) for details.
  * `helmVersion`: The semantic version constraint of the Helm client (optional). See [semver version constraints](#semver-version-constraints).
  * `tillerVersion`:The semantic version constraint of Tiller (optional). See [semver version constraints](#semver-version-constraints).


### client
This resolver is used to identify client-side environment requirements needed to run an inventory action.

The `client` resource has the following attributes:
* `<Client Prereq Name>`: A [CASE Property](010-case-structure.md#yaml-file-format) describing the client prerequisite. (Required)
  * `metadata` Describes the client prerequisite.  See [CASE Metadata](010-case-structure.md#Specification-metadata-and-versioning) for details.
  * `command`: The command name expected to be in the system path of the operating system. (Required)
  * `versionArgs`: The command line arguments needed to retrieve the version of the command. For example, the `versionArgs` parameter for `go version` would be `version`. Default: `--version`.
  * `versionRegex`: The regex to match against the output of the command to verify the expected version is installed. If not specified, any version of the command found in the system path is considered appropriate.

**Note:** The following reserved characters are not allowed in the `command` or `versionArgs` properties: `|` `;` `&` `$` `>` `<` `\` `!` `` ` ``


### ibmCoreServices
This resolver is used to identify the availability of IBM core services in the target Kubernetes cluster.  IBM core services are available with IBM Cloud Paks.

Each IBM core service resolver key is a well known service name. The value specified here is typically the primary service of a feature that an IBM Cloud Pak or IBM certified container utilizes directly.

For a detailed list of services available IBM Cloud Private Knowledge Center.

Some common components include:

* `auth-idp`: The IBM Cloud Private Identity and Access Management service.
* `cert-manager`: The component that manages the lifecycle of certificates
* `logging`: The suite of logging services, including ElasticSearch and Kibana.
* `monitoring`: The suite of monitoring services, including Prometheus and Grafana.
* `nginx-ingress`: The default Ingress that's used on the ICP Proxy nodes.
* `service-catalog`: Implements the Open Service Broker API to provide service broker integration.
* `storage-gluster-fs`: The Gluster filesystem.

Each service-resolver includes the following fields:

* `<none>` - Reserved for future use, such as versioning.


## Specifying Prerequisite Version Ranges 
A `Range` is a set of conditions that specify which versions satisfy the prerequisite. This specification utilizes basic comparisons and standard AND/OR logic to define the expected version range.

The basic comparisons are:

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>=</td>
        <td>equal</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>!=</td>
        <td>not equal</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>></td>
        <td>greater than</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><</td>
        <td>less than</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>>=</td>
        <td>greater than or equal</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><=</td>
        <td>less than or equal</td>
    </tr>
</table>

Basic comparisons are combined into logical AND and OR combinations. ANDs are specified with spaces between comparison objects and ORs are specified with the standard double-pipe character: `||`. Logical AND is given higher priority than OR and parenthesis are not supported.

Examples:
* This example will support any v1.x version above or equal to 1.11.3:
  * `>=1.11.3 <2`
* This example will support either versions 1.x through 2.x or versions 3.4.0 and above
  * `>= 1.0 <3.0.0 || >= 3.4.0`
* To support any version other than 2.11.2:
  * `<2.11.2 || >2.11.2` or, more simply:
  * `!=2.11.2`

### Non-functional versions

As stated in the [case.yaml specification](100-case.md#version), CASE supports non-functional versions. These are specified after the standard version and are prefixed with a plus sign (`+`). In order of preference, non-functional versions come after a standard release. For example, `1.0.0 < 1.0.0+20191008.162055`.
